## Introduction

Hello, I live in Tokyo and I'm currently working at Amiya Co. as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) and DevOps engineer since April 2023.
My primary role involves architecting components for our SaaS product to enhance its features on AWS.

In terms of technical skills, I am proficient in using Terraform, .NET, Shell scripting, CloudFormation, Golang, and Python.
I take great pleasure in writing code and it's also my hobby.

What excites me the most is the opportunity to create scalable and robust solutions with an agile development cycle.
I am always eager to learn and apply new technologies to solve complex problems.
